# Report timing:
# see http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time
#
# Once you have this report running to your satisfaction you can add
# report_timing to control it.
# If you are not editing any variables within this file then it only needs to
# be run once a day, to generate the current timestamp for the the URL link in
# links.inc
# With that in mind the report timing can be set to once per day - @daily
#
# @daily        0 0 * * *        Every day at midnight.
